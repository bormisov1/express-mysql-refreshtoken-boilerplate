# Node Web Application boilerplate

A boilerplate for **Node.js** web applications. It uses express.js, sequelize for mysql interaction. It uses bearer token for auth, which gets invalidated on `/logout`. On signup refresh token is returned alongside with access token, the former allows issuing new access token by requesting `/signin/new_token`. User model has id and passHash fields. Id is expected to be either a phone number or email.

### Suggested commands

`npm i`
`docker-compose up`
